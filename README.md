# Logistic-Regression-to-Predict-Customer-Choice-on-buying-SUV

Introduction:
Imagine you’ve just been assigned as a brand analyst for a particular model of Sport Utility Vehicle (SUV). Your first assignment is
to determine what, if any, relationship exists between income and a decision to purchase an SUV. You are given data from a random sample
of 1500 recent new car buyers, which includes the buyer’s household income and whether the buyer purchased an SUV or other type of car.

Your boss expects a briefing by tomorrow morning, specifically answering the following two questions:

1) Is there a relationship between income and SUV purchase?

2) How would you “model” this relationship in order to predict future behavior (e.g., How likely is a person with an income of X to buy
an SUV)? 
Note: This example is simplified (one predictor only) for illustrative purposes.
The first question is easy; the second is not.

The purpose of this project is to: 
1) discuss the shortcomings of “traditional” statistical techniques when modeling customer choice.
2) discuss a powerful, but relatively obscure, technique called Logistic Regression. 

In this project, I will make use of the “SUV analysis” example, mentioned above. This project will review some of
the steps that a business analyst might take to answer the two questions posed. The limitations of these techniques will then provide the
motivation for the use of Logistic Regression.
